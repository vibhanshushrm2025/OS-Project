A chat bot is tool used to show most recently used messages of a user
C++ files are used for designing the algorithm used in implementing this feature.
LRU algorithm is used to replace the least recently used messages.
Chat bot is a web-application and message saving tool in which the user can arrange the task according to their priority order.It is used to display messages which are more frequently and recently posted.User can limit the number of messages according to his/her needs.Highest priority message will be shown at the top.Incase of same priority the message which arrived recently will be showing at first.

                                  This application is built based on the concepts of LRU algorithm of the Operating Systems course. It displays at most a maximum number of messages to which the limit is set.
